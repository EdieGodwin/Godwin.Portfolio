This is a collection of works created during my time at CMU

# About me
I'm a Master's student at CMU studying Public Policy and Management. I am from the Atlanta area but I got my undergraduate degree in Economics from The University of Alabama at Birmingham (no, sorry, that's not the Roll Tide one). I hope to work in local governemnt when I graduate, ideally for a school system. All of the women in my family are teachers, so education policy is an area I enjoy and feel familiar with. While I have enjoyed Pittsburgh, I am **ready** to have snowless winters again! 

# What I Hope to Learn
I'm taking Telling Stories with Data to get better at data visualization, a crucial part of academic or professional communication. I've always been interested in how people learn and in making information more accessible. One of the best things you can do to help someone learn is to explain it visually. Mostly what I hope to gain from this class is an increased ability to communicate and share knowledge.
